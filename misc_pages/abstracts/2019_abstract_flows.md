Building upon the long-established thesis on the usefulness of mapping out the underlying boundaries that govern worker flows for understanding the labor market structure, this article formulates a network framework for analyzing intragenerational occupational mobility. We argue that current the literature faces three major challenges: (1) the detection of boundaries that constrain the detailed occupation-to-occupation flow of workers, (2) the incorporation of over-time changes in these boundaries, and (3) the incorporation of multi-step flows. These challenges motivated us to propose a network framework that helps address them. In this network, the nodes are defined as the detailed occupations and the weighted, directed edges as the volume and direction of workers who flow between the nodes. We then use a flow-based community detection algorithm to detect the mobility boundaries based on the observed mobility network. We apply this network approach to the analysis of trends in intragenerational occupational mobility in the United States from 1989 to 2015 and compare the recovered boundaries with class schemes in the big-class and microclass regimes. Our results suggest that the boundaries constraining mobility opportunities have become increasingly decoupled from the boundaries of macro- and micro-classes. Further, we show that failure to account for these changes may lead to an overstatement of the fluidity of intragenerational occupational mobility and an understatement of the growth in the rigidity of mobility boundaries over time. </p>
