Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the department of sociology at New York University. I work on topics in political sociology, social networks, social mobility, and quantitative methodology. 

My dissertation analyzes whether and how the U.S. has become more politically and socially polarized focusing on both public opinion trends and the distribution of social ties within society. I hold a BA in German literature and sociology from Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea.
