<div class="header-bar-blog">
  This blog is a result of a time-consuming habit of mine to write down notes on quantitative methods that I find difficult to understand (which means quite everything). 
  Most of the posts are based on old notes that were created in my first three years of graduate school. 
  The best way to understand statistical models, I believe, is to play around with them by the means of simulation. 
  Hence, almost all of the post have some theoretical considerations followed by a simulation example. 
  I hope that these materials will be helpful for students who are as confused about these methods as I was when writing down these notes.
