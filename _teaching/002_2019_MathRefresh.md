"Instead we shall have to describe this kind of relationship in ordinary language, and here we are at once in trouble, because this is just the kind of relationship that ordinary language&mdash;at least any of the Western languages&mdash;is least well equipped to describe. Ordinary language, with its subject to predicates, is geared to handling only one independent factor and one dependent factor at a time: someone is always doing something to somebody. Cause-and-effect thinking, rather than mutual-dependence thinking, is built into speech. Yet a situation that can accurately be described in cause-and-effect terms is just the kind that is encountered least often in sociology. Here the cause produces an effect, but the effect reacts upon the cause. In these circumstances, the very first effort to use ordinary language shows how crude a tool it is. Yet we shall do what we can with it, as we have nothing else."

"No part of social analysis seems more appropriate for making a start than the analysis of social structure which, as we shall presently see, is focused upon formal features and relations, that is, upon the kind of phenomena with which mathematics and logic pre-eminently deal ... A system of symbolic expressions, even in the form of a mere notational system, must help towards a sharper and more concise manner of exposition. To be sure, the technique of notation will not by itself produce significant 'formulae'; it does not automatically procure a fuller insight into the 'relationships between sociological variables.' It only equips us with a new tool for demonstrating them, if or when they are discovered. But let us not minimize the usefulness of this equipment. New tools have been known to facilitate new discoveries. They certainly produce, in those who use them, a new attitude, a new way of looking at the material to be handled: which is probably the decisive step."

Common-sense deduction probably moves by blind instinct from concrete proposition to concrete proposition, guided by some habitual association of ideas. Thus common sense fails in the presence of a wealth of material ... Logic, properly used, does not shackle thought. It gives freedom and, above all, boldness. Illogical thought hesitates to draw conclusions, because it never knows either what it means, or what it assumes, or how far it trusts its own assumptions, or what will be the effect of any modification of assumptions.
