"In applying  mathematics to subjects such as physics or statistics we make tentative assumptions about the real world which we know are false but which we believe may be useful  nonetheless ... [T]he statistician knows, for example, that in nature there never was a normal distribution, there never was a straight line, yet with normal and linear assumptions, known to be false, he can often derive results which match, to a useful approximation, those found in the real world." 

George E. P. Box. 1976. "Science and Statistics," _Journal of the Amercian Statistical Association_, 70(356), p. 792.

"A lady declares that by tasting a cup of tea made with milk she can discriminate whether the milk or the tea infusion was first added to the cup. We will consider the problem of designing an experiment by means of which this assertion can be tested ... Our experiment consists in mixing eight cups of tea, four in one way and four in the other, and presenting them to the subject for judgment in a random order ... It is no sufficient remedy to insist that "all the cups must be exactly alike" in every respect except that to be tested. For this is a totally impossible requirement in our example, and equally in all other forms of experimentation ... The element in the experimental procedure which contains the essential safeguard, is that two modifications of the test beverage are to be prepared "in random order." This, in fact, is the only point in the experimental procedure in which the laws of chance, which are to be in exclusive control of our frequency distribution, have been explicitly introduced."

Ronald A. Fisher. 1935. _The Design of Experiments_, Edinburgh: Oiver and Boyd, pp. 13-22. 

The "lady" here is Dr. Muriel Bristol, a phycologist who worked at Rothamsted Experimental Station together with Fisher. It is said that she refused the cup of tea Fisher offered her because he poured the milk into the cup before the tea. Fisher could not believe that the order in which milk and tea is added makes a difference and designed a randomized experiment. What is less well-known is that Dr. Bristol almost perfectly classified  whether the tea or the milk was infused first in the experiment that followed. 

Not only Fisher but John Wishart (probably best-known for the [Wishart Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishart_distribution)), John Nelder (who co-authored the famous monograph on [Generalized Linear Models](https://books.google.com/books/about/Generalized_Linear_Models.html?id=SPSDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false)), and William Cochran (who wrote my favorite book on [sampling techniques](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Sampling+Techniques%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780471162407)), among others, worked in the Rothamsted Experimental Station (now known as Rothamsted Research).

Also, while the introduction of the randomized experiment is often attributed to Fisher, it is documented that Charles S. Peirce, the "father of pragmatism" but better known for his works in the fields of mathematics and logic, conducted a randomized control trial half a century before Fisher, where the randomization procedure was introduced for the same reason as Fisher (on this point, see Stephen M. Stigler. 1999. <em>Statistics on the Table</em>. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 193-194.)
