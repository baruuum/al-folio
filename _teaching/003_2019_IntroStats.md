My bright friend,<br>
<br>
I am delighted with your discovery that delirium tremens is calculated to lengthen life. I am sure that this discovery will brighten the Christmas of many who otherwise might be restrained by the bat-eyed formulas & prejudices of the medical profession from keeping this festival with the conviviality they would wish. <br>
<br>
I only wish that I could give you delirium tremens so as to prolong your useful career but alas there is no royal road to d.t., it can only acquired by long personal devotion and application.
<br>
<br>
I am however sending you one of the symptoms, which was detached from the man who earned full wages while in hospital with delirium tremens.
<br>
<br>
Yours as ever<br>
Karl Pearson

"In applying  mathematics to subjects such as physics or statistics we make tentative assumptions about the real world which we know are false but which we believe may be useful  nonetheless ... [T]he statistician knows, for example, that in nature there never was a normal distribution, there never was a straight line, yet with normal and linear assumptions, known to be false, he can often derive results which match, to a useful approximation, those found in the real world."

A lady declares that by tasting a cup of tea made with milk she can discriminate whether the milk or the tea infusion was first added to the cup. We will consider the problem of designing an experiment by means of which this assertion can be tested ... Our experiment consists in mixing eight cups of tea, four in one way and four in the other, and presenting them to the subject for judgment in a random order ... It is no sufficient remedy to insist that "all the cups must be exactly alike" in every respect except that to be tested. For this is a totally impossible requirement in our example, and equally in all other forms of experimentation ... The element in the experimental procedure which contains the essential safeguard, is that two modifications of the test beverage are to be prepared "in random order." This, in fact, is the only point in the experimental procedure in which the laws of chance, which are to be in exclusive control of our frequency distribution, have been explicitly introduced.

The "lady" is Dr. Muriel Bristol, a phycologist, who had refused the cup of tea Fisher offered her because he added the milk first. It is said that she almost perfectly classified  whether the tea or the milk was infused first in the randomized experiment that ensued from their conversation. </p>
